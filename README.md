# Trains
A GUI app with two animated trains(minecarts) that loop through their individual (minecraft) rail's path, each one with it's individual speed controller. There is a selector so you can choose where wich train starts, and a reset button if you want to star all over again.

# That was the first project of the Discipline Concurrent Programming, so I've developed some skills:

In this project i've learned how to use the javafx and how to create animations on it. Also have applied the fundaments of OOP learned on Programming and Algorithms II, as inheritance, composition, encapsulation etc. And i've had some fun creating the graphic elements of this project with GIMP.
